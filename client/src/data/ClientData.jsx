She comes prepared to tackle any last minute issue that may come up all while keeping the bride, MOB, and MOH calm and enjoying the day. She is wonderful to work with and will do anything to make your day amazing... case in point I got grass clippings all in my shoes/over my feet during pictures and she literally washed my feet... :)",

      "On May 13, 2022 we had the wedding of our dreams. If we rewind 9 months earlier, we were recently engaged and just booked our date with the wedding venue. A wedding was imminent but we had no idea what to do. That is when we were fortunate to connect with Ani. From our initial call she immediately started building our timelines, so that we can understand how everything would come together and when we would need to make decisions. She also provided a budgeting tool so that we can understand our costs as we started the process of vetting vendors. In the months leading up to the wedding we would have periodic zoom meetings where we worked thru our checklists. Ani walked us thru every decision. She always listened to us and provided us with multiple options so that we can make the best decisions. She spoke to the vendors on our behalf and kept everything organized. We never felt overwhelmed in the process. In the days leading up to our wedding everything started coming together. Our expectations were that things were going to get hectic. While we definitely had some exciting moments leading up to the wedding including the birth of a new niece, everything was going very smooth on the wedding side. Ani took care of everything. On the day of the wedding Ani was there every step of the way from ordering lunch to making sure my makeup artist had everything she needed. She came to my hotel room while I was getting ready and didn’t leave my side until the wedding was over. Throughout the day, Ani handled everything and somehow still managed to always be by my side when I needed her. During our ceremony which was held outdoors there was a brief period of drizzle during our vows, and like any bride I started to panic. Before I knew it, I had a beautiful clear umbrella covering me and the stress melted away. It felt likes she was in our minds and anticipated our needs before we could verbalize them and that put us at such ease on our big day. It allowed us to just enjoy the day. I tell my husband I wish I could relieve that day again because it was like a movie. I have no doubt in my mind without Ani that could not have been possible. If you are thinking about hiring a wedding planner take it from us you will not be disappointed she is the best!",

I am a really big planner and was very much into all of the details leading up to our wedding. Ani went above and beyond to ensure we had an incredible wedding day. She provided support to our family and friends, communicated effectively with all of our vendors, managed our timeline and vendors perfectly on the day of, supported us through our rehearsal and final venue walkthrough, executed our overall wedding vision, and made sure my husband and I were happy and comfortable throughout our wedding day. We did not have to worry about anything on our wedding day! My family and I felt so supported. All of our guests raved about how organized our wedding was and so much of that can be attributed to Ani and her team. Thank you, Ani!!",

      "I do not know what I would have done without Ani. When I was planning my wedding, I truly did not think I needed a day of coordinator, but everyone I spoke to told me it was worth it. Let me tell you, after seeing everything Ani did. I promise you this was my number one vendor I needed. I would have had multiple panic attacks if I did not have Ani helping prior to the wedding and the day of. Ani showed up at 6:50 AM at the wedding day ready to jump in. She was by my side the entire day and made sure everything happened flawlessly. There was never a moment Ani was not running around making sure everything was perfect. From ensuring breakfast was arriving, getting my vendors to the correct rooms, helping carry my train, helping me in and out of my gown, bringing us water, getting our wedding party and family in the correct places, making sure my husband and I took time to ourselves, checking in to see if we needed anything, and so much more. All I can say is I could not have done it with out her and I am most grateful she was at my wedding. My best advice to anyone planning a wedding is hire Ani! It was the best decision I made in the past 2 years. Ani thank you so much for everything! I wish I had another event happening to hire you again, just so we can hangout!",

When we began working more closely together in the few weeks before the wedding, she was on top of all the details, handling conversations with vendors directly and pushing back where needed to ensure that our needs would be fully met. She also ran a rehearsal the day before the wedding, which was a much-appreciated bonus! She was ALL OVER every detail on our wedding day, everything from untying knots in a bridesmaid’s necklace to finding a huge amount of bandages for my shoe-torn feet, and running interference when needed to ensure that we could enjoy a stress-free day! She took the time to fully understand our vision for the day, the family and religious traditions involved, and any family needs, and made sure that there weren’t any surprises. And she kept everyone right on schedule! Her rates are astoundingly affordable, and you should hire her while you still can!",

They make the whole process so much easier by providing vendor suggestions, arranging meetings and being available via email when you have even the simplest of questions. The day of, Caitlin, Kellie and Jess were absolute rock stars. They handled all of the contact with vendors to ensure the day ran without a hitch and their design and décor completely transformed the venue into a wedding you can only dream about. We ran into a situation with our transportation and the girls were on it immediately, coordinating with the company and communicating with us in order to make suggestions with how to make up for lost time. Throughout the night they catered to our every need and at the end of the night gathered all of our things so we had nothing to worry about. I cannot imagine the day without them and would recommend that you not just get a planner for your day but specifically use Clover, you won’t regret it!",
